# Gesture-Recognition-Device
The Gesture Keyboard is a device that translates gestures into letters. It's made by an Arduino UNO &amp; an MPU-6050 accelerometer. It sends the data to a computer that, with a Machine Learning algorithm, translates the motion readings into characters. The library PYGARL in Python &amp; the Scikit-learn library for the SVM algorithm is used for this project.
